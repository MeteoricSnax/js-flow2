# Why would you consider a Scripting Language as JavaScript as your Backend Platform?

Javascript is currently one of the most updated and expressive scripting languages. there is constancent development and 
improvments, and this is crucial for development and security which is very important for backends, aswell as frontends.
By having a very espresive language, it makes for a low amount of code needed, which is good for fast development.

# Explain Pros & Cons in using Node.js + Express to implement your Backend compared to a strategy using, for example, Java/JAX-RS/Tomcat

By having the same language in the frontend aswell as the backend, gives you the oppotunity to become much faster in developing.
Not having to know a lot of different languages does limit what you can do, but making new things are a faster porcess,
as you only need to find the node module, that you need for the task.
As an example, deployment can be made very easy by using nodemon.
